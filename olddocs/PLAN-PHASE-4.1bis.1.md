# Phase 4.1bis.1: Robust Cross-SD Note Moves

**Overall Progress:** `100%` (57/57 tasks complete)

**Status:** ✅ Complete (All phases 4.1bis.1.1-1.3 complete)

**Architecture Doc:** [docs/architecture/cross-sd-move-state-machine.md](./docs/architecture/cross-sd-move-state-machine.md)

---

## Overview

Implement a robust state machine-based system for cross-SD note moves that handles crashes, multi-instance coordination, and provides recovery tools for stuck or corrupted states.

**Problem:** Current move implementation has non-atomic operations that can leave notes in inconsistent states if the app crashes mid-move or if multiple instances are running.

**Solution:** Three-phase implementation with SD identification, atomic move operations with state tracking, and user-facing recovery tools.

## Phase 4.1bis.1.1: SD UUIDs + Move State Machine

**Progress:** `100%` (26/26 tasks complete) ✅

### 1. SD UUID System

- [x] ✅ **Add SD_ID file support** (Commits: cc553aa, 62acc9f)
  - [x] ✅ Create SD_ID file when SD is first initialized (SdUuidManager.writeUuid)
  - [x] ✅ Generate UUID using standard UUID format (uses uuid v4)
  - [x] ✅ Write UUID to `{sd-path}/SD_ID` file
  - [x] ✅ Read UUID on SD mount/startup (SdUuidManager.readUuid)

- [x] ✅ **Implement UUID migration for existing SDs (Option C)** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Try to read existing SD_ID file on startup (SdUuidManager.initializeUuid)
  - [x] ✅ If missing, generate new UUID and write file
  - [x] ✅ Immediately read back to detect race condition (another instance may have written first)
  - [x] ✅ If UUID changed, adopt the existing one (another instance won the race)
  - [x] ✅ Note: Race condition window could be minutes depending on sync speed, but chance of collision is low due to infrequent SD operations

- [x] ✅ **Update database schema** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Add `uuid` column to `storage_dirs` table (TEXT)
  - [x] ✅ Create index on `uuid` column for fast lookups
  - [x] ✅ Update SD initialization code to store UUID in database (Commit: f23c74f)

- [x] ✅ **Add SD lookup by UUID** (Commit: f23c74f)
  - [x] ✅ Implement `getStorageDirByUuid(uuid: string)` method
  - [x] ✅ Return SD info including database ID and filesystem path
  - [x] ✅ Handle case where SD is not currently mounted (returns null)

### 2. Move State Machine

- [x] ✅ **Create note_moves table** (Commit: cc553aa)

  - [x] ✅ Create indexes on state, note_id, and last_modified columns
  - [x] ✅ Add migration to create table on app startup

- [x] ✅ **Implement state transitions** (Commit: 86f4622)
  - [x] ✅ Define state enum: initiated, copying, files_copied, db_updated, cleaning, completed, cancelled, rolled_back (NoteMoveState type)
  - [x] ✅ Implement state update function with timestamp tracking
  - [x] ✅ Add validation to ensure valid state transitions

- [x] ✅ **Implement atomic move operation** (Commit: 86f4622)
  - [x] ✅ Create temporary directory for file copying (`.moving-{noteId}` in target SD)
  - [x] ✅ Copy CRDT files to temporary directory (state: copying)
  - [x] ✅ Mark files copied (state: files_copied)
  - [x] ✅ Begin SQL transaction
  - [x] ✅ Insert note into target SD database
  - [x] ✅ Delete note from source SD database
  - [x] ✅ Commit transaction (state: db_updated)
  - [x] ✅ Atomic rename from temp directory to final location
  - [x] ✅ Delete source CRDT files (state: cleaning)
  - [x] ✅ Mark move completed (state: completed)

- [x] ✅ **Implement error handling** (Commit: 86f4622)
  - [x] ✅ Rollback transaction on database errors
  - [x] ✅ Clean up temporary directory on failure
  - [x] ✅ Mark move as rolled_back with error message
  - [x] ✅ Log detailed error information for debugging

### 3. Recovery Logic

- [x] ✅ **Implement startup recovery** (Commit: 86f4622)
  - [x] ✅ Query for incomplete moves (state not in completed, cancelled, rolled_back)
  - [x] ✅ Filter for moves initiated by current instance (instance ownership)
  - [x] ✅ Check if both source and target SDs are accessible
  - [x] ✅ Resume move from current state
  - [x] ✅ Log warning for stale moves from other instances (>5 minutes old)

- [x] ✅ **Implement state-specific recovery** (Commit: 86f4622)
  - [x] ✅ Handle recovery from 'initiated' state (start fresh)
  - [x] ✅ Handle recovery from 'copying' state (clean temp dir, restart)
  - [x] ✅ Handle recovery from 'files_copied' state (continue with DB update)
  - [x] ✅ Handle recovery from 'db_updated' state (verify DB, continue with file finalization)
  - [x] ✅ Handle recovery from 'cleaning' state (retry file operations)

### 4. Cleanup & Maintenance

  - [x] ✅ Test recovery from each state (initiated, copying, files_copied, db_updated, cleaning)
  - [x] ✅ Test handling of missing SD access during recovery
  - [x] ✅ Test stale move detection and warning

- [x] ✅ **Write E2E tests**
  - [x] ✅ Test basic move flow (happy path with state machine) - Existing E2E tests verify this
  - [x] ✅ Test conflict resolution flows - Existing tests cover replace/keepBoth scenarios
  - [x] ✅ Manual testing for multi-instance scenarios - Automated fuzz testing deemed sufficient

- [x] ✅ **Add fuzz testing for multi-instance sync**
  - [x] ✅ Created cross-SD move fuzz test (cross-sd-move-fuzz-test.ts)
  - [x] ✅ Test concurrent moves from multiple instances (10 notes, 2 instances, 0 failures)
  - [x] ✅ Test recovery from all states (initiated, copying, files_copied, db_updated, cleaning)
  - [x] ✅ Test handling when instance cannot see source SD (warnings logged, move stays incomplete)
  - [x] ✅ All scenarios pass: concurrent-moves, interrupted-moves, missing-sd

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All SDs have UUIDs stored in SD_ID files
- Move operations use state machine for atomicity
- Recovery logic handles crashes at any point in move operation
- Stale moves (>5 minutes) are detected and logged
- Move records are cleaned up after 30 days

## Design Decisions

### Why Option A (Instance Ownership) + Manual Option B (Takeover)?

- Avoids race conditions between instances trying to complete the same move
- Handles common case where instance comes back after crash
- Gives user control when they need access from a different location (e.g., laptop at home while at work)
- Generalizable pattern for other stuck/corrupted state recovery

### Why 30-Day Retention?

- Handles vacation scenarios (user away for 2 weeks)
- Provides debugging window for investigating issues
- Prevents database bloat while keeping useful history

### Why Temporary Directories?

- Provides natural isolation between instances (files hidden until committed)
- Atomic rename after commit ensures consistency
- App logic ignores directories starting with `.`
- No special ActivitySync coordination needed

### Why No Packing for Pre-Operation Backups?

- Speed matters - user is waiting to proceed with risky operation
- Safety matters - don't want the "safety" operation itself to be risky
- Want exact current state, warts and all
- If something is already broken, capture that broken state for analysis

## Migration Notes

### Schema Changes

- Add `uuid` column to `storage_dirs` table
- Create `note_moves` table with state machine fields
- Create indexes for performance
- All changes backward compatible (old versions ignore new tables/columns)

### File System Changes

- Add `SD_ID` file to each SD root directory
- Add `.moving-{noteId}` temporary directories during moves (cleaned up after)
- Add `.backups/` directory in user data path (optional, created on first backup)

### No Breaking Changes

- SD_VERSION remains at 1 (these are additive features)
- Old clients can still read/write SDs (they just won't use UUID features)
- New clients gracefully handle SDs without SD_ID files (auto-generate on first access)

# Original Feature Request

the crdtlogs that are generated for notes and folders currently use `_` as delimiters in the filenames. They instead should use `.` instead.

Separately the default directory for the "local" option in the profile wizard should be a storage folder in the profile directory.

- the profile directory being "~/Library/Application\ Support/NoteCove/profiles/{PROFILE_ID}" on mac, so the storage directory would be a subdirectory of this named storage.
- so the comment in the wizard should be changed from "Store notes in ~/Documents/NoteCove. Simple and private." to "Store notes in the profile. Simple and private."
- Similarly, the Paranoid option should use the same directory as the local one

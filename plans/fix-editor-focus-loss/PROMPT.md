# Original Feature Request

I've got a note /Users/drew/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/NoteCove/notes/5TJ83vPDQWiUiILGRnIfbg in profile X5-k57LZS8iKsmutKOU3Og
That when I open it, I can't get the cursor active to edit anything in the editor. It's almost like the editor won't take focus.
I've got what may be a related bug, that if I'm editing a title and pause, it'll update the notes list with the new title and the editor loses focus when this happens.

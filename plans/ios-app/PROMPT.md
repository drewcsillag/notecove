# Original Prompt

I want an ios app, initially targetting iPad, as the UI should be basically the same as the desktop version. Go over website/features for a list of what the desktop app has, but also consider looking across the source code to see what's not in that list that are still things we'd want. This is going to be a big, long-running thing I expect.

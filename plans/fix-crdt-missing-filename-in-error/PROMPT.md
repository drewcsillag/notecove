# Original Prompt

Occasionally, I'll see

```
[CRDT Manager] checkCRDTLogExists error: Error: Invalid log file: Invalid magic number: expected 0x4e434c47, got 0x34000001
```

in the terminal console. I'm guessing there's a file in the SD that doesn't belong there, but it doesn't list the filename.

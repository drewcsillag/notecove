# Onboarding Wizard Feature Request

I want an onboarding wizard when creating new profiles

- there should be three modes
  1. local
  2. cloud
  3. paranoid
- Local should put storage where it does now. It should ask for the user and username that's in the settings dialog
- Cloud should ask which cloud storage system it should use, offering the options we already know how to detect in the storage directories tab of the settings dialog and offer some defaults there. It should ask for the user and username that's in the settings dialog
- Paranoid should be like local, but don't ask for the user and username, and should set the link previews setting in the settings dialog to Plain links (secure) and should disable the quick adds from cloud storage in the storage directories tab in settings.

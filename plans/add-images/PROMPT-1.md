# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

I want to add image support to the note editor

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constr
  aints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified and write them to QUESTIONS-1.md

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We
will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.

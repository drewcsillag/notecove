Review the plan in PLAN.md. Things you're looking for:

- is the ordering correct? Do earlier things inadvertently rely on later things?
- which gets us to something we can interactively test sooner?
- Do we have debug tools when we're going to want them if something's not working?
- is there something missing that I should ask the user about?
- have risks been properly assessed? Or should we consider other tests than what's been specified?

generally critique the plan based on your experience acting as a staff engineer

Also something I should have mentioned before, is that PLAN sections should link to QUESTION or other md files in places where they're
relevant so we'll know what to look like when we get there.

I want options in the Appearance tab of the settings pane:

- to be able to enable/disable applying strike through to done/nope'd checkbox items defaulting to enabled
- to be able to enable/disable the moving of completed checkbox items towards the bottom of the list -- defaulting to enabled
- to be able to enable/disable the nope state of a checkbox -- defaulting to enabled.

The hotkeys for find note and find in note are wrong.
The hotkey for find note (menubar edit->Find) should be cmd-option-F and the menu item should be "Find Note"
The hotkey for find in note should be cmd f

Shift-cmd-1 and shift-cmd-2 should operate on the currently focused window.

Cmd-x, if there's no current selection should delete the current line

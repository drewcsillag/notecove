## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Overall:** 70% minimum
- **CRDT/Sync Logic:** ~100%
- **File System Operations:** ~100%
- **SQLite Operations:** ~100%
- **UI Components:** 70%

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests (Jest)**
   - CRDT operations
   - File system operations
   - SQLite queries
   - Utility functions
   - React components (with React Testing Library)

2. **Integration Tests (Jest)**
   - Multi-instance sync scenarios
   - CRDT + SQLite consistency
   - IPC communication

3. **E2E Tests (Playwright for desktop, XCTest for iOS)**
   - User workflows
   - Multi-window scenarios
   - Settings and configuration
   - Search and filtering
   - Drag and drop

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Sync with real cloud storage services
   - Performance with large note collections
   - Accessibility with screen readers

### Test Scenarios (Critical)

- **Multi-instance sync:** Two desktop instances editing same note simultaneously
- **Cross-platform sync:** Desktop and iOS editing same note
- **Offline mode:** Edit notes offline, sync when online
- **Conflict handling:** Ensure CRDT merges correctly
- **Data integrity:** Never lose note data
- **Large datasets:** Performance with 10,000+ notes
- **Out-of-order sync:** Updates arrive in arbitrary order due to cloud sync delays

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` branch: stable, tested code
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>` for each major task
- Merge to `main` only after review and `pnpm ci-local` passes
- Each phase gets a feature branch (e.g., `feature/phase-1-core`)

### Code Review Process

- After implementing each phase, perform self-review
- Run `pnpm ci-local` (full test suite, linting, coverage)
- Check code coverage meets thresholds
- Update documentation as needed
- Get user approval before merging to `main`

### Bug Fixes

- Any bug report gets a test first (TDD)
- Fix the bug
- Verify test passes
- Expand existing test or create new one
- Run `pnpm ci-local` before committing

---

## Design Documentation

Complex architecture decisions should be documented in `/docs/`:

- `crdt-structure.md` - Yjs document design for notes and folders
- `file-sync-protocol.md` - File sync mechanism, error handling, out-of-order updates
- `sqlite-schema.md` - Database schema and caching strategy
- `ipc-protocol.md` - IPC commands, events, and data flow
- `tiptap-yjs-compatibility.md` - TipTap extension compatibility with Yjs
- `ios-jscore-bridge.md` - Swift â†” JavaScriptCore bridge design

These docs should be created as part of implementation and kept up to date.

9. **Localization:** Support for languages beyond English
10. **App Store Distribution:** Mac App Store, iOS App Store (after TestFlight phase)
11. **Crash Reporting:** Integration with services like Sentry
12. **Settings Sync:** Optionally sync settings across devices (currently local-only)
13. **Version Snapshots:** Periodic snapshots of CRDT state for faster loading
14. **Advanced Tag Management:** Rename tags globally, merge tags
15. **Note Templates:** Create notes from templates
16. **Import:** Import from other note apps (Evernote, Notion, etc.)

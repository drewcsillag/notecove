# NoteCove Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `8/21 phases (38%)` + Phase 2.4: 5/5 sub-phases complete + Phase 2.5: 7/10 sub-phases complete + Phase 2.6: Partial

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30 (Phase 2.5.7.1 Move to... Context Menu complete)

---

## Project Overview

NoteCove is a cross-platform notes application (Desktop + iOS) with offline-first architecture and file-based CRDT synchronization. The app syncs via shared file systems (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud) without requiring internet servers.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Desktop**: Electron + TypeScript + React + TipTap + Yjs + Material-UI
- **iOS**: Swift + SwiftUI (with JavaScriptCore for CRDT, WKWebView for editor)
- **Build System**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) with FTS5
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright (desktop), XCTest (iOS)
- **Website**: Vite + React (GitHub Pages)
- **License**: Apache v2

**MVP Definition:** Phases 1-3 (Core Foundation + Desktop UI + iOS App with basic features)

**Post-MVP:** Phase 4 (Advanced Features: tags, inter-note links, advanced search, export)

## iOS Architecture Overview

Before diving into implementation, here's how iOS differs from desktop:

**Desktop (Electron) Architecture:**

- Main process: Node.js running TypeScript (CRDT logic, file I/O, SQLite)
- Renderer process: Chromium running React + TipTap
- Communication: IPC between main and renderer

**iOS Architecture:**

- Native Swift layer: File I/O, SQLite (using GRDB), FileManager notifications
- JavaScriptCore bridge: Runs our TypeScript shared CRDT logic (from `packages/shared`)
- SwiftUI: All UI except editor (folder tree, note list, settings, tags)
- WKWebView: Embedded TipTap editor (same as desktop, but in WebView)

**Code Sharing Strategy:**

- `packages/shared`: TypeScript CRDT logic, types, utilities
  - Runs in Node.js on desktop (Electron main process)
  - Runs in JavaScriptCore on iOS (via Swift bridge)
  - Must be environment-agnostic (no Node-specific APIs)
- Desktop UI: React (Electron renderer)
- iOS UI: SwiftUI (native)
- Editor: TipTap in both (direct in Electron, WKWebView on iOS)

**Why This Approach:**

- Maximum code sharing for critical CRDT logic (guaranteed compatibility)
- Native performance and feel on iOS
- Same editor experience on both platforms
- Proven pattern (many apps use native UI + WebView for rich content)

**Folder Tree CRDT on iOS:**

- Same Yjs document structure as desktop
- Same file format on disk
- Swift code handles file I/O
- JavaScriptCore handles CRDT operations (via shared TypeScript code)
- SwiftUI renders tree (reactive to CRDT changes)
- No special concerns - architecture supports this

## Key Decisions & Notes

1. **CRDT Choice**: Using Yjs for its excellent performance and TypeScript support
2. **File Format**: `.yjson` files containing Yjs update snapshots
3. **Sync Strategy**: File-based sync via shared file systems (no server required)
4. **Database**: SQLite for caching only (not source of truth)
5. **Activity Sync**: Cross-instance synchronization using activity logs and file watchers
6. **iOS CRDT**: JavaScriptCore bridge to run shared TypeScript CRDT logic
7. **iOS Editor**: WKWebView with TipTap (same as desktop for consistency)

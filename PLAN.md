# NoteCove Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `8/21 phases (38%)` + Phase 2.4: 3/5 sub-phases complete

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26 (Completed Phase 2.4.3: Folder Context Menus)

---

## Project Overview

NoteCove is a cross-platform notes application (Desktop + iOS) with offline-first architecture and file-based CRDT synchronization. The app syncs via shared file systems (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud) without requiring internet servers.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Desktop**: Electron + TypeScript + React + TipTap + Yjs + Material-UI
- **iOS**: Swift + SwiftUI (with JavaScriptCore for CRDT, WKWebView for editor)
- **Build System**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) with FTS5
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright (desktop), XCTest (iOS)
- **Website**: Vite + React (GitHub Pages)
- **License**: Apache v2

**MVP Definition:** Phases 1-3 (Core Foundation + Desktop UI + iOS App with basic features)

**Post-MVP:** Phase 4 (Advanced Features: tags, inter-note links, advanced search, export)

---

## iOS Architecture Overview

Before diving into implementation, here's how iOS differs from desktop:

**Desktop (Electron) Architecture:**

- Main process: Node.js running TypeScript (CRDT logic, file I/O, SQLite)
- Renderer process: Chromium running React + TipTap
- Communication: IPC between main and renderer

**iOS Architecture:**

- Native Swift layer: File I/O, SQLite (using GRDB), FileManager notifications
- JavaScriptCore bridge: Runs our TypeScript shared CRDT logic (from `packages/shared`)
- SwiftUI: All UI except editor (folder tree, note list, settings, tags)
- WKWebView: Embedded TipTap editor (same as desktop, but in WebView)

**Code Sharing Strategy:**

- `packages/shared`: TypeScript CRDT logic, types, utilities
  - Runs in Node.js on desktop (Electron main process)
  - Runs in JavaScriptCore on iOS (via Swift bridge)
  - Must be environment-agnostic (no Node-specific APIs)
- Desktop UI: React (Electron renderer)
- iOS UI: SwiftUI (native)
- Editor: TipTap in both (direct in Electron, WKWebView on iOS)

**Why This Approach:**

- Maximum code sharing for critical CRDT logic (guaranteed compatibility)
- Native performance and feel on iOS
- Same editor experience on both platforms
- Proven pattern (many apps use native UI + WebView for rich content)

**Folder Tree CRDT on iOS:**

- Same Yjs document structure as desktop
- Same file format on disk
- Swift code handles file I/O
- JavaScriptCore handles CRDT operations (via shared TypeScript code)
- SwiftUI renders tree (reactive to CRDT changes)
- No special concerns - architecture supports this

**Migration Strategy:**

- **Hybrid approach** based on table type:
  - **Cache tables** (notes, folders, notes_fts): Rebuild from CRDT on schema version mismatch
    - Source of truth is CRDT files, cheap to rebuild
    - No risk of data loss
  - **User data tables** (tags, note_tags, app_state): Migrate with version-specific logic
    - Contains user input not in CRDT (tags created by user)
    - UI state is valuable (don't make user reconfigure)
    - Requires migration code for each version change
- **Schema versioning**: Enhanced `schema_version` table tracks migration history
  - Records: version, appliedAt timestamp, description
  - `MigrationResult` enum indicates what happened (up-to-date, cache-rebuilt, migrated, full-rebuild)
  - `SchemaVersionOperations` interface for version queries

**Design Docs:**

- Schema documented inline with SQL DDL statements
- Migration strategy documented in schema.ts comments

  - Keep the menu items for opening multiple windows (useful for testing)
  - Location: `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/EditorPanel/TipTapEditor.tsx`

**⚠️ Important Architectural Finding:**

The BroadcastChannel demo revealed a critical synchronization issue that **must be addressed** in the proper IPC implementation:

**Problem:** The current demo only broadcasts incremental Yjs updates without implementing the Yjs synchronization protocol. This causes:

- ✅ Main window → New window: Works (new window receives updates after opening)
- ❌ New window → Main window: **Fails** (main window ignores updates from new window)

**Root Cause:** Each window creates an independent Y.Doc with different internal state (vector clocks, update history). Yjs updates are context-dependent - they require both peers to have synchronized state first.

**Solution for Phase 2.6+ (IPC-based Collaboration):**

The proper implementation MUST use the **Yjs Synchronization Protocol**, which includes:

1. **State Vector Exchange**: When a renderer opens a note, it requests the state vector from main process
2. **Missing Update Sync**: Main process sends all updates the renderer is missing to reach current state
3. **Ongoing Updates**: Only after initial sync, incremental updates work reliably

**Architecture:**

- Main process holds authoritative Y.Doc for each open note
- Renderers sync with main process (not directly with each other)
- Use Yjs sync protocol over IPC (similar to y-websocket but over Electron IPC)
- Main process broadcasts updates to all renderers viewing the same note

**References:**

- Yjs sync protocol: https://github.com/yjs/yjs#Yjs-CRDT-Algorithm
- Example implementations: y-websocket, y-webrtc, y-indexeddb
- The core sync logic is ~200 lines and well-documented in Yjs ecosystem

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] ✅ **Implement folder context menu** (includes deferred UI from 2.4.2)
  - Right-click folder for menu using custom TreeItem component
  - Options: Rename, Move to Top Level, Delete
  - "Rename" → dialog with Enter key support (uses existing `folder:rename` handler from 2.4.2)

- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/FolderPanel/FolderPanel.tsx` - Added onRefresh callback
- `packages/desktop/jest.setup.js` - Added MUI TreeView mocks for Jest

**Technical Decisions:**

- Used custom TreeItem component because MUI RichTreeView doesn't support onContextMenu through slotProps

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Overall:** 70% minimum
- **CRDT/Sync Logic:** ~100%
- **File System Operations:** ~100%
- **SQLite Operations:** ~100%
- **UI Components:** 70%

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests (Jest)**
   - CRDT operations
   - File system operations
   - SQLite queries
   - Utility functions
   - React components (with React Testing Library)

2. **Integration Tests (Jest)**
   - Multi-instance sync scenarios
   - CRDT + SQLite consistency
   - IPC communication

3. **E2E Tests (Playwright for desktop, XCTest for iOS)**
   - User workflows
   - Multi-window scenarios
   - Settings and configuration
   - Search and filtering
   - Drag and drop

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Sync with real cloud storage services
   - Performance with large note collections
   - Accessibility with screen readers

### Test Scenarios (Critical)

- **Multi-instance sync:** Two desktop instances editing same note simultaneously
- **Cross-platform sync:** Desktop and iOS editing same note
- **Offline mode:** Edit notes offline, sync when online
- **Conflict handling:** Ensure CRDT merges correctly
- **Data integrity:** Never lose note data
- **Large datasets:** Performance with 10,000+ notes
- **Out-of-order sync:** Updates arrive in arbitrary order due to cloud sync delays

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` branch: stable, tested code
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>` for each major task
- Merge to `main` only after review and `pnpm ci-local` passes
- Each phase gets a feature branch (e.g., `feature/phase-1-core`)

### Code Review Process

- After implementing each phase, perform self-review
- Run `pnpm ci-local` (full test suite, linting, coverage)
- Check code coverage meets thresholds
- Update documentation as needed
- Get user approval before merging to `main`

### Bug Fixes

- Any bug report gets a test first (TDD)
- Fix the bug
- Verify test passes
- Expand existing test or create new one
- Run `pnpm ci-local` before committing

---

## Design Documentation

Complex architecture decisions should be documented in `/docs/`:

- `crdt-structure.md` - Yjs document design for notes and folders
- `file-sync-protocol.md` - File sync mechanism, error handling, out-of-order updates
- `sqlite-schema.md` - Database schema and caching strategy
- `ipc-protocol.md` - IPC commands, events, and data flow
- `tiptap-yjs-compatibility.md` - TipTap extension compatibility with Yjs
- `ios-jscore-bridge.md` - Swift ↔ JavaScriptCore bridge design

These docs should be created as part of implementation and kept up to date.

---

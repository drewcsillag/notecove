- ✅ Can extract title from note content

**Design Docs:**

- ✅ Document TipTap + Yjs compatibility findings in `/docs/tiptap-yjs-compatibility.md`

Phase 2.3 successfully implemented the core TipTap editor with:

- ✅ TipTap React component with Yjs Collaboration extension

- ✅ Title extraction utility with comprehensive tests (12 tests passing)
- ✅ All unit tests passing (53 tests)
- ✅ All E2E tests passing (7 tests)
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Files Added:**

- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/EditorPanel/TipTapEditor.tsx` - Main editor component
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/EditorPanel/EditorToolbar.tsx` - Formatting toolbar
- `packages/shared/src/crdt/title-extractor.ts` - Title extraction utility
- `packages/shared/src/crdt/__tests__/title-extractor.test.ts` - Title extraction tests
- `docs/tiptap-yjs-compatibility.md` - TipTap+Yjs compatibility research

**Dependencies Added:**

- `@tiptap/react@^2.26.4`
- `@tiptap/starter-kit@^2.26.4`
- `@tiptap/extension-collaboration@^2.26.4`
- `@tiptap/extension-underline@^2.26.4`
- `@tiptap/pm@^2.26.4`

**Next Steps:**

- IPC integration to sync editor changes with main process Y.Doc
- Note loading/unloading via IPC
- Collaborative cursors (requires awareness support)

**Demo Hack (Temporary):**

- ✅ Added BroadcastChannel-based collaboration demo (see `/docs/DEMO-COLLABORATION.md`)
- 🔄 **TODO**: Remove BroadcastChannel demo code when implementing proper IPC integration (Phase 2.6+)
  - Remove demo code from `TipTapEditor.tsx` (lines 63-97)
  - Replace with proper IPC handlers for note loading/unloading
  - Replace with IPC-based Y.Doc sync from main process
  - Keep the menu items for opening multiple windows (useful for testing)
  - Location: `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/EditorPanel/TipTapEditor.tsx`

**⚠️ Important Architectural Finding:**

The BroadcastChannel demo revealed a critical synchronization issue that **must be addressed** in the proper IPC implementation:

**Problem:** The current demo only broadcasts incremental Yjs updates without implementing the Yjs synchronization protocol. This causes:

- ✅ Main window → New window: Works (new window receives updates after opening)
- ❌ New window → Main window: **Fails** (main window ignores updates from new window)

**Root Cause:** Each window creates an independent Y.Doc with different internal state (vector clocks, update history). Yjs updates are context-dependent - they require both peers to have synchronized state first.

**Solution for Phase 2.6+ (IPC-based Collaboration):**

The proper implementation MUST use the **Yjs Synchronization Protocol**, which includes:

1. **State Vector Exchange**: When a renderer opens a note, it requests the state vector from main process
2. **Missing Update Sync**: Main process sends all updates the renderer is missing to reach current state
3. **Ongoing Updates**: Only after initial sync, incremental updates work reliably

**Architecture:**

- Main process holds authoritative Y.Doc for each open note
- Renderers sync with main process (not directly with each other)
- Use Yjs sync protocol over IPC (similar to y-websocket but over Electron IPC)
- Main process broadcasts updates to all renderers viewing the same note

**References:**

- Yjs sync protocol: https://github.com/yjs/yjs#Yjs-CRDT-Algorithm
- Example implementations: y-websocket, y-webrtc, y-indexeddb
- The core sync logic is ~200 lines and well-documented in Yjs ecosystem

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] ✅ **Implement folder context menu** (includes deferred UI from 2.4.2)
  - Right-click folder for menu using custom TreeItem component
  - Options: Rename, Move to Top Level, Delete
  - "Rename" → dialog with Enter key support (uses existing `folder:rename` handler from 2.4.2)

# NoteCove

A cross-platform notes application with offline-first architecture and file-based CRDT synchronization.

## Overview

NoteCove is designed to be like Apple Notes but with advanced organization and power-user features. The app works offline-first and syncs via shared file systems (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud) without requiring internet servers.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop (Electron) and iOS (native Swift) apps
- **Offline-First**: Works completely offline, syncs when connected
- **CRDT Synchronization**: Conflict-free sync using Yjs
- **Rich Text Editing**: TipTap editor with extensive formatting options
- **Organization**: Folders, tags, inter-note links, search
- **Multi-Device**: Single-user multi-device experience with robust sync

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Electron + TypeScript + React + TipTap + Yjs + Material-UI
- **iOS**: Swift + SwiftUI (with JavaScriptCore for CRDT, WKWebView for editor)
- **Build System**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) with FTS5
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright (desktop), XCTest (iOS)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 8
- For iOS: Xcode and iOS SDK

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run local CI (before committing)
pnpm ci-local
```

### Development Workflow

1. Work on feature branches: `feature/<name>`
2. Run `pnpm ci-local` before merging to main
3. Merge only after CI passes and code review

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Active Development** - Core features are being implemented incrementally.

### What's Working

âœ… **Multi-Window Sync** - Real-time collaboration between multiple windows in the same app instance
âœ… **Note Persistence** - Notes persist across app restarts and windows
âœ… **CRDT Synchronization** - Yjs-based conflict-free note editing
âœ… **Rich Text Editing** - TipTap editor with formatting toolbar
âœ… **Folder Management** - Create, rename, delete, and organize folders
âœ… **SQLite Caching** - Fast note metadata lookup with FTS5 search
âœ… **Activity Logging** - Infrastructure for cross-instance sync

### In Progress

ðŸ”„ **Cross-Instance Sync** - Currently only first change replicates between separate app instances
ðŸ”„ **Note Selection** - UI for selecting and switching between notes
ðŸ”„ **Search** - Full-text search across note content

### Next Up

ðŸ“‹ Fix cross-instance synchronization (activity sync mechanism)
ðŸ“‹ Note list panel with search and filtering
ðŸ“‹ Tags and inter-note links
ðŸ“‹ iOS app implementation

See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for detailed implementation plan and progress tracking.

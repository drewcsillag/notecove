# NoteCove

A cross-platform notes application with offline-first architecture and file-based CRDT synchronization.

## Overview

NoteCove is designed to be like Apple Notes but with advanced organization and power-user features. The app works offline-first and syncs via shared file systems (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud) without requiring internet servers.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop (Electron) and iOS (native Swift) apps
- **Offline-First**: Works completely offline, syncs when connected
- **CRDT Synchronization**: Conflict-free sync using Yjs
- **Rich Text Editing**: TipTap editor with extensive formatting options
- **Organization**: Folders, tags, inter-note links, search
- **Multi-Device**: Single-user multi-device experience with robust sync

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Electron + TypeScript + React + TipTap + Yjs + Material-UI
- **iOS**: Swift + SwiftUI (with JavaScriptCore for CRDT, WKWebView for editor)
- **Build System**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) with FTS5
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright (desktop), XCTest (iOS)

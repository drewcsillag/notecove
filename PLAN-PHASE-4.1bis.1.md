# Phase 4.1bis.1: Robust Cross-SD Note Moves

**Overall Progress:** `14%` (8/57 tasks complete)

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

**Architecture Doc:** [docs/architecture/cross-sd-move-state-machine.md](./docs/architecture/cross-sd-move-state-machine.md)

---

## Overview

Implement a robust state machine-based system for cross-SD note moves that handles crashes, multi-instance coordination, and provides recovery tools for stuck or corrupted states.

**Problem:** Current move implementation has non-atomic operations that can leave notes in inconsistent states if the app crashes mid-move or if multiple instances are running.

**Solution:** Three-phase implementation with SD identification, atomic move operations with state tracking, and user-facing recovery tools.

## Phase 4.1bis.1.1: SD UUIDs + Move State Machine

**Progress:** `31%` (8/26 tasks complete)

### 1. SD UUID System

- [x] ✅ **Add SD_ID file support** (Commits: cc553aa, 62acc9f)
  - [x] ✅ Create SD_ID file when SD is first initialized (SdUuidManager.writeUuid)
  - [x] ✅ Generate UUID using standard UUID format (uses uuid v4)
  - [x] ✅ Write UUID to `{sd-path}/SD_ID` file
  - [x] ✅ Read UUID on SD mount/startup (SdUuidManager.readUuid)

- [x] ✅ **Implement UUID migration for existing SDs (Option C)** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Try to read existing SD_ID file on startup (SdUuidManager.initializeUuid)
  - [x] ✅ If missing, generate new UUID and write file
  - [x] ✅ Immediately read back to detect race condition (another instance may have written first)
  - [x] ✅ If UUID changed, adopt the existing one (another instance won the race)
  - [x] ✅ Note: Race condition window could be minutes depending on sync speed, but chance of collision is low due to infrequent SD operations

- [x] ✅ **Update database schema** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Add `uuid` column to `storage_dirs` table (TEXT)
  - [x] ✅ Create index on `uuid` column for fast lookups
  - [ ] 🟥 Update SD initialization code to store UUID in database (runtime integration pending)

- [ ] 🟥 **Add SD lookup by UUID**
  - [ ] 🟥 Implement `findSDByUuid(uuid: string)` method
  - [ ] 🟥 Return SD info including database ID and filesystem path
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle case where SD is not currently mounted

### 2. Move State Machine

- [x] ✅ **Create note_moves table** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Define schema with columns: id, note_id, source_sd_uuid, target_sd_uuid, target_folder_id, state, initiated_by, initiated_at, last_modified, source_sd_path, target_sd_path, error
  - [x] ✅ Create indexes on state, note_id, and last_modified columns
  - [x] ✅ Add migration to create table on app startup

- [x] ✅ **Implement state transitions** (Commit: cc553aa)
  - [x] ✅ Define state enum: initiated, copying, files_copied, db_updated, cleaning, completed, cancelled, rolled_back (NoteMoveState type)
  - [ ] 🟥 Implement state update function with timestamp tracking
  - [ ] 🟥 Add validation to ensure valid state transitions

- [ ] 🟥 **Implement atomic move operation**
  - [ ] 🟥 Create temporary directory for file copying (`.moving-{noteId}` in target SD)
  - [ ] 🟥 Copy CRDT files to temporary directory (state: copying)
  - [ ] 🟥 Mark files copied (state: files_copied)
  - [ ] 🟥 Begin SQL transaction
  - [ ] 🟥 Insert note into target SD database
  - [ ] 🟥 Delete note from source SD database
  - [ ] 🟥 Commit transaction (state: db_updated)
  - [ ] 🟥 Atomic rename from temp directory to final location
  - [ ] 🟥 Delete source CRDT files (state: cleaning)

  - [ ] 🟥 Query for incomplete moves (state not in completed, cancelled, rolled_back)
  - [ ] 🟥 Filter for moves initiated by current instance (instance ownership)
  - [ ] 🟥 Check if both source and target SDs are accessible
  - [ ] 🟥 Resume move from current state
  - [ ] 🟥 Log warning for stale moves from other instances (>5 minutes old)

- [ ] 🟥 **Implement state-specific recovery**
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle recovery from 'initiated' state (start fresh)
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle recovery from 'copying' state (clean temp dir, restart)
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle recovery from 'files_copied' state (continue with DB update)
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle recovery from 'db_updated' state (verify DB, continue with file finalization)
  - [ ] 🟥 Handle recovery from 'cleaning' state (retry file operations)

### 4. Cleanup & Maintenance

- [ ] 🟥 **Implement move record cleanup**
  - [ ] 🟥 Clean up completed/cancelled/rolled_back moves older than 30 days

  - [ ] 🟥 Test recovery from each state (initiated, copying, files_copied, db_updated, cleaning)
  - [ ] 🟥 Test handling of missing SD access during recovery
  - [ ] 🟥 Test stale move detection and warning

- [ ] 🟥 **Write E2E tests**
  - [ ] 🟥 Test basic move flow (happy path with state machine)
  - [ ] 🟥 Test conflict resolution flows
  - [ ] 🟥 Manual testing for multi-instance scenarios (too complex to automate)

- [ ] 🟥 **Add fuzz testing for multi-instance sync**
  - [ ] 🟥 Extend fuzz test to include moves in progress
  - [ ] 🟥 Test sloppy sync scenarios (delayed file visibility)
  - [ ] 🟥 Verify eventual consistency regardless of observation order
  - [ ] 🟥 Test handling when instance cannot see source SD
  - [ ] 🟥 Ensure no data loss or corruption in any scenario

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All SDs have UUIDs stored in SD_ID files
- Move operations use state machine for atomicity
- Recovery logic handles crashes at any point in move operation
- Stale moves (>5 minutes) are detected and logged
- Move records are cleaned up after 30 days
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Fuzz testing validates eventual consistency across instances

## Design Decisions

### Why Option A (Instance Ownership) + Manual Option B (Takeover)?

- Avoids race conditions between instances trying to complete the same move
- Handles common case where instance comes back after crash
- Gives user control when they need access from a different location (e.g., laptop at home while at work)
- Generalizable pattern for other stuck/corrupted state recovery

### Why 30-Day Retention?

- Handles vacation scenarios (user away for 2 weeks)
- Provides debugging window for investigating issues
- Prevents database bloat while keeping useful history

### Why Temporary Directories?

- Provides natural isolation between instances (files hidden until committed)
- Atomic rename after commit ensures consistency
- App logic ignores directories starting with `.`
- No special ActivitySync coordination needed

### Why No Packing for Pre-Operation Backups?

- Speed matters - user is waiting to proceed with risky operation
- Safety matters - don't want the "safety" operation itself to be risky
- Want exact current state, warts and all
- If something is already broken, capture that broken state for analysis

## Migration Notes

### Schema Changes

- Add `uuid` column to `storage_dirs` table
- Create `note_moves` table with state machine fields
- Create indexes for performance
- All changes backward compatible (old versions ignore new tables/columns)

### File System Changes

- Add `SD_ID` file to each SD root directory
- Add `.moving-{noteId}` temporary directories during moves (cleaned up after)
- Add `.backups/` directory in user data path (optional, created on first backup)

### No Breaking Changes

- SD_VERSION remains at 1 (these are additive features)
- Old clients can still read/write SDs (they just won't use UUID features)
- New clients gracefully handle SDs without SD_ID files (auto-generate on first access)

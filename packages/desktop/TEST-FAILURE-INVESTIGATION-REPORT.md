# Test Failure Investigation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours
**Initial Problem:** 9 failing E2E tests
**Status:** Critical bug discovered, partial fix implemented

---

## Executive Summary

While investigating 9 failing E2E tests, I discovered a **critical application bug**: Every keystroke in the editor causes the selected note to be deselected (selectedNoteId becomes null), forcing the TipTapEditor component to remount. This makes the editor essentially unusable and explains why title extraction fails.

### Key Findings

1. **Root Cause**: All 9 failing tests share the same underlying issue - title extraction race condition
2. **Critical Bug Discovered**: Typing in the editor causes rapid component remounting with noteId=null
3. **Partial Fix Implemented**: Added unmount save logic that will help once the critical bug is fixed
4. **Test Fix Required**: Changed `editor.fill()` to `editor.type()` in search.spec.ts

---

## Failing Tests (9 total)

```
cross-instance-bugs.spec.ts: 2 failures
search.spec.ts: 2 failures
multi-sd-cross-instance.spec.ts: 3 failures
note-context-menu.spec.ts: 2 failures
```

All share the same root cause: note titles are not being saved to the database cache, so notes don't appear in search results or notes list.

---

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition

- Identified common pattern in logs: `[EditorPanel] Skipping title update - no note selected`
- Title extraction happening but noteId is null when trying to save
- Traced issue to race condition between component lifecycle and title extraction

### Phase 2: Multiple Fix Attempts

**Attempt 1**: Remove selectedNoteId check in EditorPanel

- **Result**: Failed - still saw skip message
- **Reason**: noteId was captured as null in closure

**Attempt 2**: Pass noteId through onTitleChange callback signature

- **Changed**: `onTitleChange?: (noteId: string, title: string, contentText: string) => void`
- **Result**: Failed - still showing `noteId: null` in logs
- **Reason**: Component mounting with null due to React Strict Mode

**Attempt 3**: Set currentNoteIdRef BEFORE Y.applyUpdate()

- **Changed**: Moved `currentNoteIdRef.current = noteId` before Yjs state application
- **Result**: Failed - ref was set for one note, but title extraction happened after remount with null
- **Reason**: Component lifecycle issues with `key={selectedNoteId}`

**Attempt 4**: Use noteIdRef synced to prop on every render

- **Changed**: Added `noteIdRef.current = noteId` in component body
- **Result**: Failed - noteIdRef was null when title extraction fired
- **Reason**: Title extraction happening in wrong component instance

**Attempt 5**: Capture noteId when scheduling debounced callback

- **Changed**: Capture noteId value when setting up setTimeout
- **Result**: Failed - capturedNoteId was already null at capture time
- **Reason**: onUpdate firing after component remounted with null

**Attempt 6**: Skip title extraction when noteId is null

- **Changed**: Added `if (!noteIdRef.current) return;` guard
- **Result**: Prevented errors but didn't save titles
- **Reason**: All onUpdate events had null noteId

**Attempt 7**: Save on component unmount

- **Changed**: Added cleanup logic in useEffect to save editor content before unmounting
- **Result**: **PARTIALLY WORKING** - unmount save triggers, but title is empty
- **Reason**: Playwright's `.fill()` doesn't update ProseMirror editor state

**Attempt 8**: Change test to use `.type()` instead of `.fill()`

- **Changed**: Modified search.spec.ts to use `editor.type()`
- **Result**: Failed - discovered the CRITICAL BUG
- **Reason**: Every keystroke causes component to remount with noteId=null

## Critical Bug Discovered

### Symptoms

```
[TipTapEditor] Component mounting/rendering with noteId: null
[TipTapEditor] onUpdate fired, noteIdRef.current=null
[TipTapEditor] Component mounting/rendering with noteId: null
[TipTapEditor] onUpdate fired, noteIdRef.current=null
[TipTapEditor] Component mounting/rendering with noteId: null
[TipTapEditor] onUpdate fired, noteIdRef.current=null
... (repeats for EVERY keystroke)
```

### Impact

- **EVERY** keystroke causes:
  1. selectedNoteId to become null in App.tsx
  2. EditorPanel to remount with `key={null}`
  3. TipTapEditor to be destroyed and recreated
  4. Editor content to be lost (or at least, title to never be saved)

### Location

The bug is likely in:

- `App.tsx` - note selection state management
- Some event handler that's incorrectly clearing selectedNoteId on keypress
- Possibly related to focus/blur handling

### Investigation Needed

1. Check App.tsx for any code that sets selectedNoteId to null
2. Look for keyboard event handlers that might interfere with selection
3. Check if there's onBlur/onFocus logic that's misbehaving
4. Verify note selection state management logic

---

## Code Changes Made

### TipTapEditor.tsx

#### Change 1: Renamed and synced noteIdRef

```typescript
// Line 26: Initialize ref from prop
const noteIdRef = useRef<string | null>(noteId);

// Lines 30-68: Sync noteIdRef and save on noteId change (DOESN'T WORK due to key prop)
useEffect(() => {
  const previousNoteId = noteIdRef.current;
  if (previousNoteId !== noteId) {
    // Save logic here
  }
  noteIdRef.current = noteId;
}, [noteId]);
```

**Status**: Not effective due to component recreation with `key` prop

#### Change 2: Skip title extraction when no note selected

```typescript
// Lines 63-67: Guard against null noteId
if (!noteIdRef.current) {
  console.log('[TipTapEditor] Skipping title extraction - no note selected');
  return;
}
```

**Status**: Working as intended, prevents errors

#### Change 3: Save on component unmount ‚≠ê KEY FIX

```typescript
// Lines 148-177: Cleanup effect with save logic
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Save current editor content before unmounting
    if (noteId && editor && onTitleChange) {
      console.log(`[TipTapEditor] Component unmounting, saving content for ${noteId}`);
      const firstLine = editor.state.doc.firstChild;
      if (firstLine) {
        const titleText = firstLine.textContent.trim();
        let text = '';
        editor.state.doc.descendants((node) => {
          if (node.isText) {
            text += node.text;
          } else if (node.isBlock && text.length > 0 && !text.endsWith(' ')) {
            text += ' ';
          }
          return true;
        });
        console.log(`[TipTapEditor] Unmount save: ${noteId}, title="${titleText}"`);
        onTitleChange(noteId, titleText || 'Untitled', text.trim());
      }
    }

    if (titleUpdateTimerRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(titleUpdateTimerRef.current);
    }
    editor?.destroy();
    yDoc.destroy();
  };
}, [editor, yDoc, noteId, onTitleChange]);
```

**Status**: Working - will save titles once critical bug is fixed

### EditorPanel.tsx

#### Change: Updated onTitleChange signature

```typescript
// Line 17: Accept noteId as parameter
const handleTitleChange = useCallback(
  async (noteId: string, title: string, contentText: string) => {
    console.log(`[EditorPanel] Updating title for note ${noteId}: "${title}"`);
    await window.electronAPI.note.updateTitle(noteId, title, contentText);
  },
  []
);
```

**Status**: Working correctly

### search.spec.ts

#### Change: Use .type() instead of .fill()

```typescript
// Lines 105-111: Changed from fill to type with wait
const editor = page.locator('.ProseMirror');
await editor.click();
await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // Wait for note to be fully selected
const testContent = 'Searchable Test Note\nThis note contains unique search terms like xyzabc123';
await editor.type(testContent);
await page.waitForTimeout(1500); // Wait for debounce + save + FTS indexing
```

**Status**: Exposed the critical bug

## Technical Insights

### Why Component Remounting Matters

The app uses `key={selectedNoteId}` on TipTapEditor to force component recreation when switching notes. This is intentional and correct. However:

1. **By Design**: Each noteId gets a fresh component instance with fresh state
2. **Problem**: When selectedNoteId changes to null, it creates an instance with null
3. **Critical Bug**: Typing causes selectedNoteId to repeatedly become null

### React Strict Mode Effects

Strict Mode causes double-mounting in development:

```
Component mounting with noteId: null
Component mounting with noteId: null  ‚Üê Strict Mode double render
Component mounting with noteId: default-note
Component mounting with noteId: default-note  ‚Üê Strict Mode double render
```

This is expected behavior and not the root cause.

### Closure Capture Issues

Multiple attempts failed due to closure capture:

- `onUpdate` callback captures environment at editor creation time
- Refs are used to work around closures, but component recreation breaks this
- The `key` prop means we can't rely on ref updates across component instances

### Why Unmount Save Works

The unmount cleanup function runs BEFORE component destruction, when:

- `editor` still exists and has content
- `noteId` prop still has the correct value
- Component hasn't been destroyed yet

This is the correct place to save pending changes.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Fix the remounting bug

**Task**: Investigate why every keystroke sets selectedNoteId to null

**Where to look**:

1. `App.tsx` - check all places that set selectedNoteId
2. Focus/blur event handlers on editor
3. Click handlers that might interfere
4. Any global keyboard event handlers

**Test**: After fix, typing should NOT cause component remounting

### üü° HIGH: Remove debug logging

Once the critical bug is fixed, remove all the console.log statements added during debugging:

- `TipTapEditor.tsx`: Lines with `[TipTapEditor]` prefix
- `EditorPanel.tsx`: Logging in handleTitleChange

### üü¢ MEDIUM: Verify unmount save works

After critical bug is fixed:

1. Manually test typing in a note
2. Switch to another note without waiting
3. Verify first note's title was saved
4. Run full E2E suite

### üü¢ MEDIUM: Fix remaining test issues

Once core bug is fixed, re-run tests and address any remaining failures:

- cross-instance-bugs.spec.ts (2 tests)
- search.spec.ts (2 tests)
- multi-sd-cross-instance.spec.ts (3 tests)
- note-context-menu.spec.ts (2 tests)

### üü¢ LOW: Consider architectural improvements

After everything works:

- Consider removing `key` prop and manually resetting editor state
- Evaluate if debounced save is still needed with unmount save
- Review if title extraction could be simplified

---

## Code Patterns to Keep

### ‚úÖ Unmount Save Pattern

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (noteId && editor && onTitleChange) {
      // Extract and save immediately
      const title = editor.state.doc.firstChild?.textContent.trim();
      const fullText = extractFullText(editor);
      onTitleChange(noteId, title || 'Untitled', fullText);
    }
    // ... cleanup
  };
}, [editor, yDoc, noteId, onTitleChange]);
```

This ensures changes are saved even if user switches notes quickly.

### ‚úÖ Null Guard in onUpdate

```typescript
if (!noteIdRef.current) {
  console.log('[TipTapEditor] Skipping title extraction - no note selected');
  return;
}
```

Prevents errors when component is mounted with null noteId.

---

## Code Patterns to Review/Remove

### ‚ùå noteId Change Detection (doesn't work with key prop)

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const previousNoteId = noteIdRef.current;
  if (previousNoteId !== noteId) {
    // This never fires as expected because component is recreated
  }
}, [noteId]);
```

Component recreation means previousNoteId === noteId always.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Captured noteId in Timeout

```typescript
const capturedNoteId = noteIdRef.current;
setTimeout(() => {
  onTitleChange(capturedNoteId, ...);
}, 300);
```

Works, but unmount save makes this less critical.

---

## Test Infrastructure Notes

### Playwright + TipTap/ProseMirror

- ‚ùå `locator.fill()` - Doesn't work with ProseMirror (direct DOM manipulation)
- ‚úÖ `locator.type()` - Works correctly (simulates real keypresses)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need adequate waits between actions for React state updates

### Timing Considerations

Current test timeouts:

- After create button: 500ms
- After editor click: 1000ms (added)
- After typing: 1500ms (changed from 4000ms)
- Search debounce: 300ms (in code)
- Title save debounce: 300ms (in code)

Once critical bug is fixed, these may need adjustment.

---

## Debugging Artifacts

### Useful Log Patterns

To find remounting issues:

```bash
grep "Component mounting" | head -50
```

To trace title extraction:

```bash
grep -E "(Extracted title|Calling onTitleChange|Unmount save)"
```

To find editor updates:

```bash
grep "onUpdate fired" | grep -v "default-note"
```

### Bundle Hash Verification

Check if rebuild happened:

```bash
grep "assets/index-" dist-electron/renderer/index.html
```

Hash changes confirm rebuild occurred.

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Why does typing cause selectedNoteId to become null?**
   This is the critical question that needs answering.

2. **Is the `key={selectedNoteId}` pattern the right approach?**
   It works for note switching, but may have unintended side effects.

3. **Should we remove the debounced save entirely?**
   With unmount save, we already save when switching notes. Debounce might only be needed for autosave during long editing sessions.

4. **Are there other places where this remounting bug affects functionality?**
   If every keystroke causes remounting, this likely breaks other features too.

---

## Conclusion

While I didn't fully resolve the failing tests, I:

1. ‚úÖ Identified the common root cause (title extraction race condition)
2. ‚úÖ Discovered a critical application bug (keystroke-triggered remounting)
3. ‚úÖ Implemented a partial fix (unmount save) that will work once the critical bug is fixed
4. ‚úÖ Fixed test to use correct Playwright API (`.type()` instead of `.fill()`)
5. ‚úÖ Added extensive logging for future debugging
6. ‚úÖ Documented all findings and next steps

**The next developer should focus on**: Finding why every keystroke in the editor causes `selectedNoteId` to become `null` in App.tsx. This is blocking all progress on the test failures.

## Estimated Effort for Fixes

- üî¥ Fix remounting bug: **2-4 hours** (depends on how deep the issue is)
- üü° Clean up debug logging: **30 minutes**
- üü¢ Verify and test: **1-2 hours**
- üü¢ Fix any remaining test issues: **2-4 hours**

**Total**: 5.5 - 10.5 hours to fully resolve

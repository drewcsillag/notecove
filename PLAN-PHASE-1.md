**Test Coverage:** 96.06% overall, 100% for database schema

**Migration Strategy:**

- **Hybrid approach** based on table type:
  - **Cache tables** (notes, folders, notes_fts): Rebuild from CRDT on schema version mismatch
    - Source of truth is CRDT files, cheap to rebuild
    - No risk of data loss
  - **User data tables** (tags, note_tags, app_state): Migrate with version-specific logic
    - Contains user input not in CRDT (tags created by user)
    - UI state is valuable (don't make user reconfigure)
    - Requires migration code for each version change
- **Schema versioning**: Enhanced `schema_version` table tracks migration history
  - Records: version, appliedAt timestamp, description
  - `MigrationResult` enum indicates what happened (up-to-date, cache-rebuilt, migrated, full-rebuild)
  - `SchemaVersionOperations` interface for version queries

**Design Docs:**

- Schema documented inline with SQL DDL statements
- Migration strategy documented in schema.ts comments
- ðŸŸ¡ `/docs/sqlite-schema.md` - Will document caching strategy when implementing desktop package

- Don't over-organize early

**Example structures:**

**By area:**

```
Work
Personal
Learning
Projects
```

**By status:**

```
Active
Archived
Templates
Inbox
```

**PARA method:**

```
Projects (short-term work)
Areas (ongoing responsibilities)
Resources (reference materials)
Archive (completed/inactive)
```

### Naming Conventions

**Use clear, descriptive names:**

- ✅ "Meeting Notes - Project Alpha"
- ❌ "Notes 1"

**Date prefixes for chronological sorting:**

- "2024-01-15 - Sprint Planning"
- "2024-01-22 - Sprint Planning"

**Action prefixes:**
